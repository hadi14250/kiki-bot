# Kiki

Kiki is a Python bot designed to bypass the bot detection systems of X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and Instagram to scrape valuable profile information, including:

- Username
- Follower/Following Count
- Post Count
- Post Likes
- Post Date
- Post/Tweet Texts

## Overview

Kiki is part of a larger project called SCOM (Secure Commerce for Online Marketing). Its primary role is to analyze the followers, likes, posts, and activity of users who sign up on the platform and calculate a suggested rate that appears on their SCOM profile. This rate aids companies and startups in selecting the right influencers for their products and negotiating a fair price. Once a deal is made, influencers can post the content provided by the company. Kiki then verifies if the post matches the content given, ensuring consistency and authenticity.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-Powered Rate Suggestions:** Implementing an AI model to enhance the accuracy of suggested rates.
- **Post-Activity Analysis:** Using AI to study activity after a post is made, refining the rating mechanism.
- **Intelligent Matching System:** Developing an AI model to recommend suitable influencers to companies and vice versa, creating a seamless matchmaking system.
